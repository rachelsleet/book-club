## Book Club

This is a project designed to help manage book clubs. So far it includes the following features:

- Sign in/Sign up
- Create a new Book Club or join an existing one
- Search for books using _Google Books API_ https://developers.google.com/books/
- Add a book to your club's Bookshelf
- Browse your club's books and their info
- Remove any unwanted books

### Features that I'd still like to build out:

- Set up a poll to vote on the next book you'll read
- Calendar event to schedule next club meeting
- Apply a user status to a book e.g. Currently reading, read etc.
- Enable private groups

## Specifications

The app is built with Create-React-App (plus React-Router and React-Context) and Firebase for hosting, authentication and database storage.

Basic styling coming soon with Bootstrap.
